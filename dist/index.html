<h2 id="pitch">Pitch</h2>
<ul>
<li>Importance of accuracy is a value judgement that differs in different settings, even in one place (Birthday song vs symphony orchestra stage)</li>
<li>Mathematics and minor adjustments for reasons that are not “natural” (despite claims of naturalness), including equal temperament and Greek history</li>
<li>Organization in scales and modes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes-vs-pitches">Notes vs pitches</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frequency as measurements for pitch (with interactive)</li>
<li>Description of overtone system with link to the interactive could be useful here</li>
<li>Notes as meaningful pitch levels within a relational system, or maybe sounds that have length, placement, relationships to other sounds, etc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitch-manipulations">Pitch manipulations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modifying the pitch of a sound to create dramatic or emotive expression, for example (other types? complexity?)</li>
<li>Ornaments:
<ul>
<li>Scoop into a pitch, fall away from a pitch</li>
<li>Others that make use of rhythms or other textures</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="negotiating-mathematics-and-reality">Negotiating mathematics and reality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greek system of ratios (briefly)</li>
<li>Building a scale</li>
<li>Tuning systems: just, equal, gamelan (with interactive that allows for random and a visual showing relationship)</li>
<li>Cultural/historical/social importance of some of these relationships, like equal coming out of a need to play in multiple keys, demonstrates a negotiation between a (social) ideal of perfection and a compositional aspiration toward completeness, for example</li>
<li>Valuing participation: Happy Birthday</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitches-vs-motion">Pitches vs motion</h3>
<ul>
<li>A set of pitches (scale) used at random vs a collection of related pitches that carry expectations in terms of melodic development and motion (interactive with randomized pitches vs a maqam performance)</li>
<li>This sense of mode is not unique to other places (India, Middle East), it defines how we conceptualize major and minor</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="texture">Texture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Odetta, Moses, Moses as example of multiple melody</li>
</ul>
