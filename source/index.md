## Pitch (Target: 100)

* Importance of accuracy is a value judgement that differs in different settings, even in one place (Birthday song vs symphony orchestra stage)
* Mathematics and minor adjustments for reasons that are not "natural" (despite claims of naturalness), including equal temperament and Greek history
* Organization in scales and modes

### Notes vs pitches (Target: 200)

* Frequency as measurements for pitch (with interactive)
* Description of overtone system with link to the interactive could be useful here
* Notes as meaningful pitch levels within a relational system, or maybe sounds that have length, placement, relationships to other sounds, etc

### Pitch manipulations (Target: 200)

* Modifying the pitch of a sound to create dramatic or emotive expression, for example (other types? complexity?)
* Ornaments:
  * Scoop into a pitch, fall away from a pitch
  * Others that make use of rhythms or other textures

### Negotiating mathematics and reality (Target: 200)

* Greek system of ratios (briefly)
* Building a scale
* Tuning systems: just, equal, gamelan (with interactive that allows for random and a visual showing relationship)
* Cultural/historical/social importance of some of these relationships, like equal coming out of a need to play in multiple keys, demonstrates a negotiation between a (social) ideal of perfection and a compositional aspiration toward completeness, for example
* Valuing participation: Happy Birthday

## Melody (Target: 200)

* Scales vs mode: music and motion
* A set of pitches (scale) used at random vs a collection of related pitches that carry expectations in terms of melodic development and motion (interactive with randomized pitches vs a maqam performance)
* This sense of mode is not unique to other places (India, Middle East), it defines how we conceptualize major and minor

### Linear relationships (Target: 200)

* Melody and harmony
* Support and attention

## Texture (Target: 200)

* Interactions, textures (poly- vs mono-, ornamentation and heterophony)
* Monophony with a few examples

### Almost the same: heterophony (Target: 200)

* Fiddle and Middle Eastern examples of ornamentation and heterophony
* Happy Birthday as another example

### Supporting a main idea (Target: 200)

* Focus of attention
* Note about the term heterophony/drone
* Examples with drones, chords, rhythm guitar

### Multiple melody/polyphony (Target: 200)

* Odetta, Moses, Moses as example of multiple melody
* Something public and participatory (Amazigh?)
* Open questions about how an ensemble works (what's the focus of attention?)

## Moving on (Target: 100)

* Playing with the sequencer, link
* Importance of relationships, whether internal (pitches, scales, melodies) or between parts and people
