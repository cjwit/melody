## Try it yourself

The large boxes under the melody and bass loops control the timbre of those sounds. They are connected to filters: drag the circle to the right or left to change one effect, up and down to change another.

<div id="playButton"></div>

<div id="melodyLoop" class="loop"></div>

Drag the circle to add or remove distortion and delay.

<div id="synthEffects" class="effects"></div>

<div id="bassLoop" class="loop"></div>

Drag the circle to add or remove "BitCrusher" and "Chorus" effects.

<div id="bassEffects" class="effects"></div>

<div id="drumLoop" class="loop"></div>
