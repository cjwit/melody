Musical ideas are, at some level, intertwined sounds. While talking about sound can be difficult and, especially in the case of *timbre* or sound color, we are often stuck with metaphorical language. There are some terms that are broadly useful. Unlike a discussion on western music theory and history, this essay provides a brief overview that avoids the specifics of one musical system or another. That said, none of these ideas are universal. They can be seen as tools, ready to be applied to understand or describe something unfamiliar or new, almost as a crutch that is available until a stronger indigenous comprehension is possible.[^universal]

[^universal]: TODO cite sources exemplifying and arguing for indigenous theories of musical construction. Aside from being "intertwined sounds," musical ideas are also heavily indebted to the social constructs and contexts that surround them. In that vein, the "close reading" techniques shown here present only a sliver of the many ways to understand music and musical activity.

## Notes and pitches

Music is made up of notes. These are sounds that are organized in some way for the sake of making music.[^music] While a note is a specific sound that is articulated (by a violinist, computer, or whomever), we can look at it's characteristics in an individual way and consider how this note interacts with others around it to build larger musical ideas. Since sound is comprised of sound waves, notes have certain physical attributes. Many have pitch: a clear frequency that makes a note sound "higher" or "lower." Others have less clarity due to more complex sound waves. These *indeterminate* or *indefinite* pitches are more difficult to hear as distinct. Knocking on two different spots on the wall might create a "higher" and a "lower" sound, but in many cases, they are not so clearly defined that you can take that sound and find its representation on a piano, for example. I do remember electronic keyboards from when I was a kid in the 1980s and 19990s, though, that manipulated knocks or dogs barking to create a series that mapped to distinct pitches. It's worth remembering that these terms are only useful insofar as they help to describe something. They are not categories that every sound easily fits into.

[^music]: Not all organized sounds are music. Intention matters, as does perception. Personally, I find the adjective "musical" to be fruitful as a way to discuss elements of non-music that might be perceived as musical. The Islamic call to prayer or the recitation of the Quran is an example of this: as a sacred activity, it is distinctively *not* music, despite its melodies and internal rhythms [@nelsonArtRecitingQur2001].

```

```

For notes that do have clear pitch levels, we measure their pitch in terms of *frequency*, the number of sound waves that pass in a second. A concert A, a common reference pitch for orchestral musicians, has a frequency of 440 hz.

```
Interactive: frequency slider
```

As an aside, tone color or the sound of the sound is a result of complex layerings of different waves. [This interactive](https://imaginary.github.io/harmonics-explorer/) lets you add different frequencies to a base pitch to create new tone colors. The specific frequencies are related (they are part of the *harmonic series*) and combining them adds complexity to the main sound wave. After clicking "English" near the bottom and "Unmute" to hear the sound, try clicking the "Square" and "Sawtooth" buttons to hear common electronic synthesizer sounds. You can also move the individual pitches (called *harmonics*) to create your own tone color. Clicking the up and down arrows changes the current note, which also shortens the length of the sound waves (increasing their frequency).

If all of this seems technical, it's because it is. And if it seems like it doesn't matter, that's because it often does not, at least in terms of how we hear sound and music. Elite western musical systems have a history of prioritizing pitch in a way that dominates "standard" notation. Staff lines create a sense of certainty, despite the fact that pitch certainty is *not* universal.[^notation] Instead of connecting a note's pitch to a frequency and judging its accuracy, we hear pitch in relation to other pitches. Is it higher or lower? Part of an ascending line or one that descends? Is it close to its neighbors or a leap away from them?[^perfect] Even further, in many musical practices, accuracy doesn't really matter at all: imagine singing "Happy Birthday" with a big family. If everyone joins in with energy but completely disagrees on the pitch, it can still be a powerful moment of community and celebration. In fact, people may laugh and enjoy the moment more. This is quite different from the sets of priorities that are in play when a symphony orchestra takes the stage.

[^notation]: Systems of notation themselves are somewhat recent developments. Because the standardization of pitch in western music happened in specific ways and at specific times, it is worth remembering that even within the histories that created these notational representations, pitch was not always imagined with the same certainty that it is today [see @haynesPitch2001].

[^perfect]: Ane exception is people who can identify specific pitches "absolutely" instead of using "relative" pitch, which is generally called "perfect pitch." Someone with perfect pitch can hear a sound and say that it is an A (440Hz). For some with a condition called synesthesia, this may also involve seeing color or another mixture of the senses.

## Organizing and manipulating pitch

It's rare for music to include only a single pitch. Notes make use of a variety of pitches in combination with rhythm, color, instrumentation, interactions between people, and so on. The pitches—which are the focus here—are usually drawn from a predefined set by the composer or improviser. Taken at random, pitches might be too close in frequency to distinguish, or they may not fit within a listener's preconceived ideas of what "goes" together. Think about colors: we have a lifetime of looking at color pallettes that give us context as to what we like or don't like. Some even have meaning. A sports rivalry might make combinations like gray and red or blue and yellow loved or hated. We similarly have a lifetime of listening to music, some of which is globally present and some of which is quite local. This leads to a shared comfort with some pitch systems, but allows for a wide diversity of others that may still feel unfamiliar.

These pitch sets or collections are often called *scales*, though the name implies more than that and can be used in different ways. Some common collections, or scales, have known names like "major" or "minor." Others have names, but they are not as widely known: jazz players may learn the "super locrian" scale. Others are associated with regional styles, like "saba" in Arab music or "pelog" in Balinese music.

```

```

These collections put pitches into specific relationships to each other. Some are built on mathematical ratios drawn from Greek music, though others are adapted to account for specific needs within musical styles or practicalities related to instruments. Western music is often described as coming out of Greek ratios, but as composers looked for more flexibility within those clear mathematical structures, they (and instrument builders) adapted. Now, most Western music is "tempered," or adjusted slightly so that a single instrument like a piano can play different scales. It's a trade-off between mathematical purity and pragmatism.

And people are not mechanical in their music making. Simple error may pull a note "out of tune," or away from where the listener expects it to be. Our ears are trained for this, even if we may not know it or have words to describe it, as demonstrated by listening to early episodes of *American Idol* or similar singing competitions. Composers and performers can manipulate pitch intentionally, as well, to great effect. Jazz players "scoop" into notes or "fall" away from them. Intonation (tuning) a note slightly differently can make a chord (a set of pitches) resonate powerfully. Purposeful de-tuning can be dramatic, grating, or signal tension.

```

While scales are collections of pitches that music makers can draw from, these sets also carry expectations for listeners. First, there are not "hard and fast" rules about what goes together. Pushing the boundaries can lead to innovation, but composers and improvisers balance that innovation against listener expectation. Pushing too far might lead to confusion.[^serialists] Second, pitch and melody align closely in traditions across the world to create a sense of motion and anticipation. It is difficult to divorce pitch from the motion that gives it life over time in actual music. To illustrate this sense of expectation, here is an example that uses pitches from a western major scale. It is not random, I set up a melodic idea, but go somewhere unexpected. In some cases, this kind of shift can be powerful or beautiful. In others, like this one, it's striking, odd, or simply sounds wrong to my ears.

[^serialists]: In some cases, like so-called "serialist" composers in Western classical tradition, these boundaries are intentionally pushed to the point of breaking. By using pitch and other musial elements in ways that feel chaotic or are so highly ordered that they operate outside of the norms of the tradition to that point, people like Anton Webern or Pierre Boulez expand the idea of what a scale can mean. They fully step outside of listener expectation.

```

Because scales are a foundational element of music making, albeit a flexible one, there is much more to describe. They grow from historical contexts and innovations and music makers use them in quite different ways across styles and geographies. In some cases, pitch, scales, and intonation are of supreme importance: on the symphony stage, everyone tunes to an oboe's A, which is, in turn, tuned to a tuner or piano set at 440 hertz. Pitch is specific. But an out of tune rock band guitar can sound awful or characteristic, perhaps even "grungy," evoking the central aesthetic of "do-it-yourself" punk rock. The fixtures themselves are not universal, neither is an adherence to a mathematical purity, even though accuracy can be wrapped into a sense of value in some musical settings. Pitch, as it exists in any given musical context or tradition, deserves to be discussed as a part of that whole with attention to the values and systems that govern the music, musicians, and creativity. With that warning in mind, I turn toward other relationships between music's sounds, some of which come out of or are related to pitch.

## Part 2 intro: Melody

Melodies are often mysterious combinations of sounds, of notes, that together create an idea, something with an identity that a listener will notice and understand as single thing. At their simplest, a melody is a sequence of notes—each of which has some element of pitch and rhythm—that we perceive as a unit. If this sounds vague, that's because it is. Melody, like so many other parts of music, depend on a composer or improvisor's innovation within and as it relates to listener experience and expectation. Since creativity is all about creating something new and experience is based on the old, an idea must have a delicate balance. The simplest melodies are some of the most difficult to create: how can you make something that is fresh without pushing the bounds too far? And if you push the bounds further, is it possible to find a different set of listeners—a different audience—for whom your work is perfect?

Melody, like so much else in music, is therefore dependent on expectation. As sequences of notes, melodies have the additional ability to create and satisfy their own internal expectations. By combining notes in familiar ways, music makers can develop ideas, bringing the listener along. Sometimes, those pathways will be well worn (which is not to say that they are dull). At other times, a composer may turn away from the path. If executed well and if the audience has the experience to appreciate the innovation, this can generate huge amounts of tension and satisfaction. If not, though, it can be jarring. Here is an example based on western traditions. Note that this is not meant to be a universally "felt" set of melodies. To the contrary, you may hear them in a way that differs from the labels that I use, which apply to me, my listening, and my experiences.

```

```

### Linear relationships and harmony

In these cases, I only give one single melody. Each is an idea in isolation. How you hear it, however, may depend on what context you would expect to sit alongside it. This is because so much musical activity is based on relationships between different musical ideas. Sometimes these are simultaneous (two ideas are happening at once). It's also worth thinking about these relationships sequentially since repetition so important to how we hear and understand music—how are expectations are set up—that it is difficult to overstate. This relates to ideas of *musical form*, large structures that unroll over time, and *rhythm*, which is a topic for another time.

Listen to these melodies again. I'll add different *countermelodies*, other musical ideas, other melodies, that run "counter" to the main idea.

```
Same melodies, with countermelodies
```

Once  we have multiple ideas occurring simultaneously, we can begin thinking about concepts that are related to pitch and melody: harmony and texture. *Harmony* can be defined in many ways, like most of these musical terms. A description that is broad enough to be useful when talking about musical styles from people everywhere might focus on pitches or notes that sound at once. We don't only perceive harmony when things happen at once, though. Instead, our brains are pretty good at understanding when notes are meant to "go together," even if they unfold over time. An arpeggiator is a piece of equipment that takes a harmony (a set of pitches) and plays them in order over a wide range. The word is an adaptation of the word *arpeggio*, which is a series of notes that we hear as a single harmony, even though they are played sequentially. Listen to a demo and pay close attention to how you might hear "motion" or some kind of change when the player's fingers change notes. Even though we hear one note after the other, albeit in quick succession, we can usually understand the relationship between the pitches as blocks, in a way. Musical training might give someone the ability to recognize and identify those blocks, but people who don't have that training can usually hear the motion through the changing harmonies. That said, if you were to listen to passing harmonies that were unfamiliar, everything might simply sound chaotic or random. This can be the case for some people listening to things like "hard bop" jazz styles that use "extended harmonies."

One of the main uses of harmony involves support. Music makers use countermelodies (secondary melodies), arppegiators or similar technologies, chords (blocks of harmony or notes sounded together), and other forms of simultaneity to support a main idea. While sometimes the main idea is not clear or moves around an ensemble, there is often a melody that serves as a focal point. Harmony and other supportive musical ideas can change the way we hear the main idea, as was the case with the melodies and countermelodies above. They can also change the entire feel of a piece of music by shifting our attention. There are some useful terms for describing the ways in which musical ideas interact, and these fall under the umbrella of *texture*.

## Texture

As is the case with many of the terms used throughout these short essays, it is best to understand the vocabulary used for texture as descriptors rather than categories. Most music has elements of different textures happening simultaneously and the usefulness of these words as rigid buckets that a musical example fits into is limited. They can, however, help to describe specific elements of what we hear at specific moments in time.[^greek] 

[^greek]: Furthermore, these are words that have histories in the analysis of Western classical music. Their etymology in English and Greek (-phony, meaning sound) shows this. I use them here in the broadest possible sense, making them more applicable to non-Western musical styles.

### A single line

*Monophony* is the most straightforward texture, referring to a single musical line. It may be isolated and, importantly, it may be performed by multiple singers or instruments. If a group of people are singing the same melodies in the same way at the same time, it is likely a *monophonic* texture. Common examples include [some types of chant in churches or other religious settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBwh1OXw6uI), including the [recitation of the Quran, Islam's holy book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrhsPWlTXl4). Secular monophonic traditions include English ballad singing or [Irish *sean nós*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8paj2hQHIo).

Since lines between textures are not always clear, I include a secondary texture here that others may categorize elsewhere: a *drone texture*. It is common for monophonic performance to happen in conjunction with a drone, which is an underlying bed of sound that stays relatively consistent. The chant example linked above has a drone in the organ. Here is another example from India's classical music traditions featuring Ali Akbar Khan, an important *sarod* player. The drone is from the *tanbura*, the traditional drone instrument in this particular tradition, though one that is increasingly being replaced by an electronic box or cell phone app!

### The same, but different

*Heterophony* is a similar texture to *monophony*, but where the *mono* in monophony highlights the singularity of the main melodic line, the *hetero* (meaning different) in heterophony notes the existence of variation. Instead of monophony's single line, heterophony includes multiple versions of the same melody, but performed slightly differently. This usually involves *ornamentation*, or minor and often spontaneous or improvised decorations. Classical music traditions in the Middle East and North Africa commonly feature heterophony, as do fiddle traditions from places like Ireland and the American Appalachia region. [Here is an example from the National Arab Orchestra, based in Detroit, Michigan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJknCTCYme8) Listen for the instruments varying the melody ever so slightly, especially as the energy rises. Another example from an old time music festival in Appalachia shows that many people playing slightly different versions of the same melody can create a dense sound.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/naCLCHMjOiM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autzoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Both of these examples, however, also have other things going on. They are not *just* heterophony. Instead, the nuanced melodic interactions happen in conjunction with other musical ideas. This leads us to another type of texture.

### Different ideas

Once we start thinking about *all* of the stuff going on in a piece of music, we might find different melodies or musical ideas that are not the same. Sometimes this is called *multiple melody* or *polyphony*. The drone texture mentioned above could be an example if you consider the static note its own musical idea. This kind of ambiguity is good: it allows for different people to hear music in different ways.

An important distinction exists between types of polyphony. The question becomes whether there is a focal point or "main idea" that is supported by other sounds or if the different melodic lines are competing for listener attention. Some traditions (including American and global popular music styles) usually focus on a single melody with other lines supporting that, often sung, melody in different ways. Others, however, highlight interactions in a way that draws your attention in all sorts of directions.

This example from Indonesia's *gamelan gong kebyar* tradition shows one extreme. The textures are so dense in some spots that it is difficult to listen to one specific line. Instead, to me at least, the sound exists as a whole instead of its distinct parts.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldPMifPbngc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This example by the band Pearl and the Beard shows how polyphony can add a colorful texture within American popular music styles. When the two singers begin, they are singing different melodies with different words. As you listen, think about whether one stands out as more important.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHBsO3jHLfo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this same example, there is yet more stuff going on, though. Right after hitting play, you hear a bass, some pitched bells, a drummer playing with brushes, and so on. Each of these musical ideas might reach out and grab your attention for a moment, but they are largely supportive of the focal point, which is somewhere else. Within global popular styles, this is the most common type of interaction between melodies: much of the activity supports a main idea, the melody that you might walk away humming after the piece of music comes to a close. Listen to this example from Odetta, an important figure within the American folk revival of the 1960s. In "Moses, Moses," you hear Odetta's voice as the main melody, but the bass line underneath it is also really interesting. Is it supportive or competing? There are some clues, like how the volume of the voice is much louder and therefore easier to hear, but it's still an open question at times. Consider how these interact, but mostly, enjoy listening and, perhaps, falling into the music.

## Textured techniques

Some other common techniques make use of the relationship between melodic ideas. It can be useful to have names for them when describing music and sound. I'll include the vocabulary mentioned above and, in the case of new ideas here, I'll give an example.

Density

: This is not a technique, but it a useful way of describing texture. Dense, or thick, textures have a lot going on. [Ornette Coleman's experiments with "free jazz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPDzlSda8P8) are a good demonstration. There is a lot going on at once. The gamelan example from Bali listed above is another. A "thin" texture, one that is less dense, would be the opposite. Depending on how it sounds, it could be described as "clear" or "simple."

Drone

: This texture, described above, involves a static or almost static note or sound that sits underneath another melody.

Harmonization

: Harmonization can have a few different definitions. The most useful one or this purpose is two or more melodic lines that move in parallel to a central melodic idea. In this way, the different lines create a harmony, but they are very much in support of a single melody that is the focus. [The Andrews Sisters took advantage of this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8of3uhG1tCI), as did many others, especially in gospel, doo wop, and various folk traditions.

Heterophony

: Described above, heterophony happens when multiple voices or instruments play the same melody, but in slightly different and ornamented ways.

Homophony

: This happens when an important melodic idea is supported by something else. There is some overlap with other concepts like harmonization and polyphony. In homophonic textures, however, you don't necessarily have to hear specific melodies moving along with the melody (like harmonization) or running counter to it in support (like certain examples of polyphony). This [example from Brazilian bossa nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6w3a2v_50U) shows how João Gilberto's guitar is interesting and has some internal melodies, but its role is supportive of his singing. 

Monophony

: Described above, this is a single melody texture and includes cases where multiple voices (sung or instruments) perform the same melody, the same way, at the same time.

Ostinato

: An ostinato is a repeated melodic phrase that can be used as a building block for dense textures. In [this example from Latin jazz, based in Afro-Cuban mambo styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5tRGMHfKrE), the bass melody begins, then saxophones add their own ostinato, followed by trombones, then trumpets. Together, these become a dense bed of sound for Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet solo.

Ornamentation

: While not a texture, ornamentation is the decoration of a melody. It can be improvised and leads to a change from monophony to heterophony in many traditions.

Polyphony

: Described above, polyphony involves different melodic ideas happening simultaneously.

## Building textures

Despite the many overlaps between these ideas and terms, they serve a purpose. They give some names to the things we hear when listening. They also show the importance of relationships between musical ideas. These relationships may be between individual pitches or scales as they unfold over time, or between melodies and musical parts. Perhaps most significantly, the relationships between people themselves, even performers and listeners, help to give meaning to music.

You are invited to play with some of these ideas yourself using [a sequencer that loops melodies](http://cwitulski.com/loopBuilder/). It will allow you to create different melodic ideas and to listen to how they interact as you change them up.
